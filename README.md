# ML-Project (Total 30 Marks)
## GitHub Repo (5 Marks)
For my IT Assignment, I created a GitHub repository to store all my code in one place. This GitHub repo is also a submission for 5 Marks.

## Linear Regression (5 Marks)
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning method that finds a linear equation to best display the correlation between data points.
For my Linear Regression, I used a data set that involved forest fires, and I chose to plot a graph between Area Burned and Temperature, as I believe that this best shows the correlation of the data points. I have also added a bar graph of Area Burned per Month to provide extra insight into the data, despite it not being Linear Regression

## KNN (5 Marks)
KNearest Neighbours is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the nearest neighbours of a data point to classify it to a group. 
For my KNN, I used a data set that shows information about cars such as price, and iterates through different amounts of neighbours to get the best accuracy. The overall accuracy and the confusion matrix are then printed

## Clustering (5 Marks)
Clustering, or KMeans Clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups unlabeled data based on their similarity to each other. This is commonly used for data analysis and pattern recognition.
For my Clustering, I used a data set from Scikit, which shows information about the flower Iris. I chose to cluster the points based on their sepal width and length, as this information would allow the data to be classified into different groups. The data was seperated into three groups, and plotted onto a graph

## Reinforcement Learning (10 Marks)
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that trains something to make decisions that achieve the most best results, this is done by rewarding the algorithm when it makes a desired step. 
For my Reinforcement Learning, I used the MountainCar-v0 environment. I created the environment so I could see how the car moves and reset it to start over. Then, I divided the game’s world into a grid to keep track of where the car is and played the game many times and updated the grid with rewards based on the car’s actions. I used these rewards to optimise the algorithm and testing the model with different parameters
